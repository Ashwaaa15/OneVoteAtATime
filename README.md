# OneVoteAtATime
"One Vote at a Time" is a local voting system built using Java in NetBeans with a Swing-based GUI and XAMPP backend. It has 8 modules for managing elections, candidates, voters, voting, and results. Admins control the process, while approved users can vote and view results. It is a Beginner-friendly Java project that I built for my Java course.
