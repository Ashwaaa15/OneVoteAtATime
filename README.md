# OneVoteAtATime
"One Vote at a Time" is a local electronic voting system developed using Java in the NetBeans IDE. The project features a GUI-based frontend built with Java Swing (JFrame), and a backend powered by XAMPP for local database connectivity. Designed to ensure secure and efficient voting, the system includes eight core modules: 
(1) Intro Page – where users and admins can log in or view results; 
(2) Main Menu – allows admins to manage elections, candidates, voters (with approval system), and view results; 
(3) Candidates Page – for adding, editing, and deleting candidate details; 
(4) Elections Page – for managing election events; 
(5) Civilians Page – for managing voter information; 
(6) Voting Page – where approved civilians can cast their vote securely; 
(7) Result Board – displays election results to both admins and civilians; and 
(8) Manifesto Page – provides access to each candidate’s manifesto. This project demonstrates a modular, user-friendly approach to building a digital voting system for local environments.
